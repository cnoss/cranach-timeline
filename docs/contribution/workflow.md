- A `develop` branch is created from `master`
- `feature` or `bugfix` branches are created from `develop`
- When a `feature` or `bugfix` is completed it is merged into the `develop` branch
- In case issues emerge on a release candidate, they are documented as a bug and developed just like a feature with
high priority.
