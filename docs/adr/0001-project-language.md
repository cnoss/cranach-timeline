* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Alexander Strutz, Anja Bertels, Benjamin Pagelsdorf, Dominik Deimel
* Date: 2020-06-11 

## Context and Problem Statement

The project should have a uniform use of language. 
The existing issues are written in German, but the code should be written in English by default. 
Therefore, it has to be decided which language should be used for the ADR documentation.

## Considered Options

* English
* German


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: English for the documentation and code, issues and GitHub Wiki entries remain in German. The documentation and code are strongly related and need to be consistent. However, existing issues and GitHub entries do not need to be edited. 

### Positive Consequences 

* Consistent language for the code and documentation
* No changes need to be made to the existing issues and GitHub Wiki entries

### Negative Consequences 

* No consistency between code / documentation and issues / GitHub Wiki

## Pros and Cons of the Options 

### English

* Good, because it's consistent with the code
* Good, because it provides a better possibility for discussion of english technologies / patterns
* Bad, because it's inconsistent with the issues and GitHub Wiki


### German

* Good, because it's the native language of most team members
* Good, because it's consistent with the issues and GitHub Wiki
* Bad, because it's inconsistent with the code
