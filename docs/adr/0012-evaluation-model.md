# Iterative testing as evaluation model

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Anja Bertels, Dominik Deimel
* Date: 2020-12-07

## Context and Problem Statement

In the context of UI tests, it must be determined whether these are completed after one run, or whether multiple iterations are to be performed.

## Considered Options

* Iterative Testing
* Non Iterative Testing

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "iterative testing", because this model provides for more substantiated and well evaluated results.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Iterative Testing

* Good, because feedback can be obtained again after the changes have been implemented
* Good, because the test procedure can be improved and individualized
* Bad, because a higher amount of work is required
* Bad, because there can be contradictions among the tests

### Non Iterative Testing

* Good, because the amount of work is less
* Bad, because a more comprehensive test procedure is required
