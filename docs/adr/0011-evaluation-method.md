* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Anja Bertels, Dominik Deimel
* Date: 2020-12-02

## Context and Problem Statement

For the execution of UI tests a reasonable testing method must be defined.

## Considered Options

* Interview
* Tasks
* Exploration
* Eye Tracking

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Interview and explorative Tasks", because it is the combination of the given options. 
The eye tracking option cannot be implemented due to the current Covid-19 pandemic.

## Pros and Cons of the Options 

### Interview
* Good, because specific aspects can be addressed
* Good, because it allows better communication with the participant
* Bad, because it is a very static approach

### Tasks
* Good, because work can be done with targeted tasks
* Good, because  specific requirements can be tested
* Bad, because there is no free exploration
* Bad, because it is not obvious which findings the user draws himself

### Exploration
* Good, because the natural interaction of the participant with the system can be observed
* Bad, because some aspects can be neglected

### Eye Tracking

* Good, because it provides specific measured values
* Good, because the natural interaction of the participant with the system can be observed
* Bad, because it requires personal contact
* Bad, because it requires special technology
