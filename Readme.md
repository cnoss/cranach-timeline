# Cranach Timeline

For the [Cranach Digital Archive](http://lucascranach.org), an alternative access in the form of a timeline is to be 
created. This access is intended to help laypersons in particular to gain an overview and to develop an understanding 
of Cranach's life and work. Emphasis is placed on clarity and navigation. The categories can be divided into
paintings, graphics and archivals. The existing CDA is not to be replaced, but only extended by another level. The 
timeline should support the targeted search as well as the exploration of Cranach's works.
